I am a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Johns Hopkins University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Benjamin Grimmer](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~grimmer/) studying optimization. I received my M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics from Johns Hopkins as part of my PhD studies, and prior to that I received a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.A. in Chemistry from the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill. I also worked in software for an electronic healthcare company for three years between my undergraduate and graduate studies.

Research Interests
======
My current research is in optimization, focused on continuous optimization and first-order methods. I am intersted in where theory and application intersect. One particular area of my work is computer-assisted algorithm design, a type of "meta-optimization" problem in which a computer can optimize the parameters of an optimization algorithm.
